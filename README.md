### Jon_Curtis_eventTracker

## Summary<br>
<p> My app is going to serve those who seek to have better planning and less forgotten events. 
I want the user to be able to set important times and events throughout the day and be able to know they will receive reminders or alarms to inform them. 
Users may choose my app for its functionality and security. 
Since the app is going to be designed around ease of use it should be easy for users to make quick entries or deletions. 
I would want the engagement with my app to be kept down to a minimum amount of time so the user can continue with their day.<br>

<br></p>
## Functions<br> 
<p> For this project I have decide to work on making an event tracking app. 
Make goals for this app is to make is to use and understand planner that is secured by the need to login. 
I will need a login screen to show when the app opens that also allows the user to register. 
Once logged in I would have a calendar show each date either displaying events that have been scheduled or how many event are on that date. 
Selecting the date would list out the events scheduled and the time they are scheduled for or allow the user to add events. 
When adding a event the user would be able add a time the event started and details about the event as well as setting up a alarm to remind the user of the event as 
it approached.<br>
<br></p>

## Success?<br>
<p> To be honest no, there is a lot of improvement and functionality that needs worked on.<br>
<br></p>

## Approach<br>

<p> I really ran short on time so I spent most of my time trying to just get something done.<br>
